## Test Plan

### What requirements should be tested

* The Server must follow the minimum requirements for HTTP 1.1
* The Server must work on Windows (Only have access to a windows PC).
* The access log should be viewable from a text editor.

These test are the ones I will be able to test.

### What requirements should NOT be tested

* The Server should be responsive under high load.
* The Server must work on Linux and Mac.
* The Source code should be released under GPL-2.0.

I´m unable to test these, I have neither knowledge nor resourses to test the server under high load.
I have no access to linux or mac computers.
I have no qlue how to test if the code is releasable under GPL-2.0.

### How the testing will be done

The Testing will be manual testing with testcases built from the usecases provided.


### Responsibilities

All responsibilities are distributed to Tester #1, as this is a one man crew.
